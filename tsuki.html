<p>Tsuki was lonely. A stressful job. A thankless boss. A busy, chaotic life in a noisy city. But one day with the arrival of a plain letter... everything changed for Tsuki.</p>
<p>The letter was from Tsuki's grandfather who had passed away, leaving Tsuki the family carrot farm in rustic Mushroom Village. What a perfect opportunity for a new beginning.</p>
<p>Now, here in the countryside, away from all the noise and stress of a former life, Tsuki quickly comes to appreciate the simple things.</p>
</p>Whether it's fishing with Yori the fox, reading books with Chi the giraffe, or sampling the most delicious bowl of ramen made by Tsuki's good friend, Bobo the panda... every moment is precious.</p>
<p>Join Tsuki in an awe-inspiring adventure and discover all the beauty that country life has to offer.</p>
